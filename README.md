## Installation
In the command line, you'll want to complete three steps: type "npm install", "npm run seed", and "npm start" and hit enter in order to connect to the server and have all of the corresponding dependencies run.

## Usage
This blog requires a user with an existing account to sign in or a new user to sign up. With or without the user signed in, they will first be directed to the homepage when they visit localhost:3001. The nav bar offers a "home", "dashboard", and "logout" button once signed in. The user can then view their dashboard, create a new post, or delete or edit an existing post. The home page displays all blog posts created by any user using the site.
